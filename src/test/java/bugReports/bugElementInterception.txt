Bug: Element Interception Exception

Issue:
When running tests via normal execution, due to the intrusive advertisements on the website, sometimes
I get an "element intercepted exception" despite installing and ad blocker, and using Wait for the elements to load.
It is unpredictable, because normally, these tests work with execution.

How to reproduce:
Unfortunately there is no reliable way to reproduce it, it occurs randomly.
