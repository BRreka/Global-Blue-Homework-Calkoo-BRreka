Bug: No Error message is shown for amounts higher than 999.999.999

Issue:
When executing test cases for input that is higher than 999.999.999, the API should have provided an error message,
but there is none, it accepts them and calculates accordingly.

Extra info:
I cannot write numbers higher than 999.999.999 in these fields when testing manually.

Example:
When executing the test method for calculating Finland's 24% vat rate, when the without Vat field is provided with
"2200000000", it shows no error message.

How to reproduce:
Run test methods for the amounts higher than 999.999.999.
