Bug: Websocket error - connection reset

Issue:
When running tests via normal execution, sometimes I get a "Websocket error - connection reset" message.
It is somehow related to the Webdriver teardown method, it gets invoked too soon when it shouldn't.
It occurs only in some of the test methods, which is also random.
It is unpredictable, because normally, these tests work with execution.

How to reproduce:
Unfortunately there is no reliable way to reproduce it, it occurs randomly. However, when disabling the method with
"@AfterEach" annotation, it never occurs.
