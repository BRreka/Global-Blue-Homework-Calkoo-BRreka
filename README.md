# Global Blue Homework - Calkoo Vat Calculator Test Automation

## This is my solution for automating tests for Calkoo's Vat calulator (https://www.calkoo.com/en/vat-calculator)

For this project, I used Page-Object Model (POM), I separated the elements and Selenium code from the test cases.
+ Used singleton pattern for Webdriver to make sure only one instance is invoked during test runs
+ I made a test case to check if the webpage is loaded
+ And several test cases for a randomly selected country to test it's functioning correctly

## Prerequisites
+ Maven

## Technologies used
+ Java 17
+ Selenium with Webdrivermanager (Chromedriver)
+ Junit5

## Bugs
+ I provided bug reports in "Global-Blue-Homework-Calkoo-BRreka/src/test/java/bugReports/" directory
